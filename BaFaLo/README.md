# BaFaLo: Barcode Fast Localizer

![BaFaLo Logo](./BaFalo-Logo.png) 

> **Official implementation of the CAIP 2025 paper "A Deep-Learning-Based Method for Real-Time Barcode Segmentation on Edge CPUs".**

**BaFaLo (Barcode Fast Localizer)** is an ultra-lightweight neural network for barcode localization and segmentation. It is specifically designed and optimized for real-time performance on low-power edge CPUs, eliminating the need for dedicated hardware accelerators. The model features a two-branch architecture with a local feature extractor and a global context module, tailored for low-resolution inputs to maximize inference speed while maintaining high accuracy for both 1D and 2D barcodes.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The model is inspired by Fast-SCNN but is heavily streamlined for our use case. It consists of four main modules: a Learning to Downsample module, a Coarse Feature Extractor, a Feature Fusion module, and a Classifier that uses a pixel shuffle operation for high-quality upsampling.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Ultra-Lightweight:** Designed specifically for real-time performance on low-power edge CPUs without dedicated accelerators.
- **High Speed:** Achieves an inference time of just **57.62 ms** on a single core of a Raspberry Pi 3B+, approximately 9x faster than YOLO Nano.
- **Accurate:** Maintains a high decoding rate, nearly on par with YOLO Nano for 1D barcodes and only 3.5 percentage points lower for 2D barcodes, despite being significantly faster.
- **Segmentation-Based:** Employs a segmentation architecture that is robust to scale variations and does not rely on anchor boxes.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** The repository provides the full pipeline for training, evaluation, and benchmarking.
