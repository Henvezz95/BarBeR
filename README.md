# BLB: Barcode-Localization-Benchmark
The repository contains multiple algorithms for 1D and 2D barcode localization proposed in different papers in the past years. The repository contains the tools to measure the performance of those algorithms

# Installation Instructions
To build the libraries you first need to install:
- OpenCV for C++ (v4) and OpenCV contrib (Instructions [here](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)) 
- Install Boost with the following command: sudo apt -y install libboost-filesystem-dev
